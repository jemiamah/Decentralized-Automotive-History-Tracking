# Decentralized Automotive History Tracking

## Overview

A blockchain-based solution for creating immutable, transparent vehicle histories. This platform eliminates information asymmetry in the automotive market by providing verifiable records of a vehicle's entire lifecycle - from initial registration through maintenance, accidents, and ownership transfers. By decentralizing vehicle data storage and validation, we empower consumers, reduce fraud, and build trust in the automotive ecosystem.

## Core Smart Contracts

### 1. Vehicle Registration Contract
Establishes the digital identity of each vehicle on the blockchain.
- Records VIN, make, model, year, and initial specifications
- Validates manufacturer data and official registration information
- Creates tamper-proof record of vehicle production and first sale
- Stores technical specifications and factory configuration details
- Links to IPFS for storage of supporting documentation (e.g., photos, certificates)

### 2. Maintenance Log Contract
Creates a comprehensive service history accessible to all stakeholders.
- Records maintenance events with timestamps and mileage readings
- Tracks parts replacements with serial numbers and warranty information
- Stores repair details including diagnosed issues and resolutions
- Validates service provider credentials and certifications
- Implements quality ratings for service outcomes

### 3. Accident Reporting Contract
Documents collision events and subsequent repairs with verification.
- Records accident details including date, location, and severity
- Tracks insurance claims and processing status
- Documents repair methods and replacement parts used
- Validates through multiple sources (police reports, insurance, repair shops)
- Maintains photographic evidence on IPFS with tamper-proof hashing

### 4. Ownership Transfer Contract
Manages the chain of title throughout a vehicle's lifetime.
- Processes ownership changes with digital signatures
- Records sale prices (optional) and transaction dates
- Manages lien holder information and financing status
- Implements odometer verification at transfer points
- Prevents title washing through cross-validation with other contracts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16.0+
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat recommended)
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet
- IPFS node (for document storage)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automotive-history-tracking.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd automotive-history-tracking

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy contracts to test network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Usage Examples

### For Vehicle Manufacturers/Initial Registration

```javascript
// Example: Register a new vehicle
await vehicleRegistrationContract.registerVehicle(
  vinNumber,
  make,
  model,
  year,
  initialOwnerAddress,
  technicalSpecsHash,
  registrationDocumentHash
);
```

### For Service Centers

```javascript
// Example: Log a maintenance event
await maintenanceLogContract.recordService(
  vinNumber,
  serviceDate,
  mileage,
  serviceType,
  technician,
  partReplacements,
  diagnosisDetails,
  serviceInvoiceHash
);
```

### For Insurance Companies

```javascript
// Example: Record an accident report
await accidentReportingContract.logAccident(
  vinNumber,
  accidentDate,
  location,
  severityCode,
  damageDescription,
  assessorId,
  policeReportHash,
  damagePhotosHash,
  claimId
);
```

### For Vehicle Owners/Dealers

```javascript
// Example: Transfer vehicle ownership
await ownershipTransferContract.transferOwnership(
  vinNumber,
  currentOwnerAddress,
  newOwnerAddress,
  transferDate,
  odometerReading,
  saleDocumentHash
);
```

## Key Benefits

- **Reduced Fraud**: Eliminates odometer tampering, title washing, and service history manipulation
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Provides complete vehicle history to potential buyers
- **Increased Resale Value**: Well-documented vehicles with verified histories command higher prices
- **Streamlined Processes**: Simplifies insurance claims and ownership transfers
- **Data Ownership**: Gives vehicle owners control over who can view their vehicle's data
- **Interoperability**: Creates standardized records accessible across the automotive ecosystem

## Privacy Considerations

While blockchain data is publicly available, our system implements:
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive information verification
- Owner-controlled access rights for detailed records
- Selective disclosure for necessary information
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations

## Verification Methods

The system uses multiple methods to ensure data integrity:
- Multi-party validation for critical events
- IoT integration for automatic data collection (mileage, diagnostics)
- Document hashing with IPFS storage
- Authorized validator networks (certified mechanics, assessors)
- Cross-referenced event validation

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Beta launch with selected manufacturers and service centers
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile app release with scanning capabilities for VIN and documents
- **Q4 2025**: Integration with leading dealership management systems
- **Q1 2026**: Expansion of IoT capabilities (OBD integration, telematics)
- **Q2 2026**: Implementation of machine learning for fraud detection
- **Q3 2026**: International expansion with multi-jurisdiction support
